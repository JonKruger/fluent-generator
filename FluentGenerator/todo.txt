- generate methods
- options
- split generation out of the *Expression classes
- need an "ExpressionFactory" (so that PropertyExpression does not have to new up FieldExpressions)
- output file needs a grouping so that i can set open and close ns expressions
- IGenerator vs. IGeneratable - confusing
